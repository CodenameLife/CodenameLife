Anki is a [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) flashcard program.
It is designed to simplify knowledge maintainable. It is mostly used for:
 * Learning foreign languages [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1O16TMQTD0)[2](https://fluent-forever.com/the-method/spaced-repetition/)[3](http://amir.rachum.com/blog/2016/10/19/learning-a-language-with-anki/)
 * Learning facts, especially on medicine [1](http://drwillbe.blogspot.com/2011/08/anki-guide-for-medical-students.html)[2](https://www.yousmle.com/basic-anki-cards-the-complete-guide-for-med-school-and-the-usmle-step-exams/)[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K2StK7e3ww)[4](http://tedpak.com/learn.html)
 * Learning programming (Janki Method [1](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/use-spaced-repetition-with-anki-to-learn-to-code-faster-7c334d448c3c)[2](http://lifehacker.com/5973887/the-janki-method-shortens-the-time-itll-take-you-to-learn-to-code)[3](https://www.oxbridgenotes.com/articles/janki_method_refined))
 * (Experimental) Belief inculcation
 * (Experimental) Skills renewal management (To keep skills, they needs to be practiced ones for a while. Anki is a good candidate to be used to manage this process.)
